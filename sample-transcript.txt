Meeting with John and Mary Smith - Estate Planning Consultation
Date: March 15, 2024
Location: Office Conference Room

John Smith (age 58) and Mary Smith (age 55) from Austin, Texas came in today to discuss their estate planning needs. They've been married for 25 years and have two children - Michael (22) and Sarah (19).

John owns a successful construction company structured as an LLC, estimated value around $2.8 million. They also own their primary residence in Austin worth about $850,000 and a vacation home in Colorado worth $400,000.

Key concerns discussed:
- What happens to the business if something happens to John
- Making sure both kids are provided for equally
- Minimizing estate taxes
- John mentioned his first marriage and that Michael is from that relationship

Mary seemed very interested but said "We really need to think about this and discuss it more at home. This is a big decision." John agreed, saying "The timing feels right, but we want to make sure we understand all the options."

They asked about costs - quoted $8,500 for comprehensive estate plan including business succession planning. Neither objected to the price.

Next steps: They want to review the materials I gave them and will call within 2 weeks to schedule the next meeting. Mary specifically said "We'll definitely be in touch - this is too important to ignore."

Overall good meeting - they understand the value and seem motivated to move forward after they discuss privately.
