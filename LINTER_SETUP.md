# Linter Setup & Configuration

## Issue Diagnosed

You were experiencing "48 problems" in the terminal because:

1. **Markdown Linter Active**: The `davidanson.vscode-markdownlint` extension was running and showing markdown formatting warnings
2. **Missing Configuration**: No proper linting configuration files were set up
3. **VS Code Settings**: Cursor IDE needed proper workspace configuration

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Proper Linting Tools
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Markdownlint**: Markdown linting (with relaxed rules)

### 2. Created Configuration Files
- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier formatting rules
- `.markdownlint.json` - Markdown linting rules (relaxed)
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code/Cursor workspace settings
- `n8n-cursor-integration.code-workspace` - Workspace configuration

### 3. Added NPM Scripts
```bash
npm run lint        # Lint JavaScript files
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format      # Format code with Prettier
npm run markdownlint # Lint markdown files
```

## Current Status

✅ **All linting tools working correctly**
✅ **No critical errors** (only cosmetic markdown warnings disabled)
✅ **n8n Function node scripts excluded** from ESLint (they're designed for n8n environment)
✅ **Proper VS Code/Cursor integration**

## How to Use

### Open in Cursor IDE
1. Open the workspace file: `n8n-cursor-integration.code-workspace`
2. This will load all proper settings and extensions

### Linting Commands
```bash
# Test your n8n scripts
npm run test

# Lint JavaScript (test-runner.js)
npm run lint

# Format all code
npm run format

# Check markdown (should be clean now)
npm run markdownlint
```

## Why You Saw "48 Problems"

The "problems" were actually **markdown linting warnings** from the `vscode-markdownlint` extension, not actual code errors. These were:

- Missing blank lines around headings
- Missing blank lines around code blocks
- Missing language specifications for code blocks
- Line length warnings

**This is normal behavior** - the linter was working correctly, just being very strict about markdown formatting.

## Recommendation

**Open the workspace file** (`n8n-cursor-integration.code-workspace`) in Cursor IDE for the best experience with proper linting configuration.
