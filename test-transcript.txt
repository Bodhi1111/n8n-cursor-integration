Test Client: Estate Planning Advisor Meeting

Transcript Date: December 15, 2024
Client: Sarah Johnson
Location: Maryland

ADVISOR: Good morning Sarah! Thanks for joining our estate planning consultation today. Where in the world are you joining us from?

SARAH: Good morning! I'm calling from Maryland. I live here with my husband and our two children.

ADVISOR: Wonderful! Tell me a bit about your family situation.

SARAH: Well, we have a blended family. I have two stepchildren from my husband's previous marriage, so we have four kids total in the household. The youngest is 8 and the oldest is 16.

ADVISOR: That's great. And what brings you to estate planning today?

SARAH: We're really concerned about making sure all the children are taken care of if something happens to us. We also have an LLC that we started last year - it's a consulting business that's been doing really well. We're projecting about $1.2 million in revenue this year.

ADVISOR: That sounds like you've built something substantial. What's your overall estate value looking like?

SARAH: Between our home, the business, and our other assets, we're probably looking at around $2.8 million total.

ADVISOR: Excellent. And what are your main concerns with estate planning?

SARAH: Our biggest worry is making sure the stepchildren are treated fairly alongside our biological children. We also want to protect the business and minimize taxes. My husband had some health issues last year, so this feels pretty urgent for us.

ADVISOR: I completely understand that urgency. Those are all very valid concerns, especially with a blended family and business interests.

[Discussion continues about estate planning options, trusts, and tax strategies]

ADVISOR: Based on everything we've discussed, I think our comprehensive estate planning package would be perfect for your situation. The total investment would be $3,200, but I can offer you a discount today bringing it down to $2,700.

SARAH: That sounds reasonable. We've been putting this off too long, and after my husband's health scare, we really need to get this done.

ADVISOR: Absolutely. Are you ready to move forward today?

SARAH: Yes, let's do it. I have my credit card ready.

ADVISOR: Perfect! Let me get your payment information and we'll get started building your documents right away.

[Payment processing and next steps discussion]

ADVISOR: Wonderful Sarah! Your payment has been processed and we'll begin building out your estate planning documents immediately. You should receive your first draft within two weeks.

SARAH: Thank you so much! This is such a relief to finally have this taken care of.
