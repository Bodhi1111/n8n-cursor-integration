  "prompt": "You are an expert estate planning sales analyst with 20+ years of experience analyzing client meetings. Analyze this transcript with extreme precision and attention to nuanced language.

CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES (Be precise - these drive follow-up strategy):

üéØ CLOSED WON:
- Client explicitly said \"yes\", \"let's move forward\", \"when do we start?\"
- Signed engagement letter or made payment
- Scheduled immediate next steps with lawyer/implementation
- Said \"we're ready to proceed\" or equivalent commitment

‚ùå CLOSED LOST:
- Explicitly declined: \"not interested\", \"we'll pass\", \"going elsewhere\"
- Price objection with no willingness to negotiate
- Chose competitor by name
- Cannot afford and unwilling to find alternatives

üìû FOLLOW UP (Most common - requires nuanced detection):
- \"We need to think about it\" / \"discuss with spouse\"
- Interested but needs more information
- Timing concerns (\"maybe next year\", \"after tax season\")
- Wants to research or compare options
- Good meeting but no immediate commitment
- Any meeting where client was engaged but didn't commit

üö´ NO SHOW:
- Meeting didn't happen, client absent, or immediately rescheduled

FAMILY STRUCTURE DETECTION (Critical for estate planning):
- Blended families: Previous marriages, step-children, half-siblings
- Special needs: Any mention of disabled beneficiaries requiring special trusts
- Minor children: Ages, guardianship needs, education funding
- Estranged family: Family conflicts affecting inheritance planning

BUSINESS ENTITY PRECISION:
- LLC: Limited Liability Company (most common)
- S-Corp: S Corporation (tax implications)
- C-Corp: C Corporation (different tax structure)
- Partnership: General or Limited Partnership
- Sole Proprietorship: Individual business ownership
- Professional entities: PC, PLLC, etc.
